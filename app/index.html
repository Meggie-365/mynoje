								<p> My name is Margaret Ekung and i am  a Nigerian. I am a graduate of Electrical Engineering because i love to do things that most people feel females can not do.<br><br> I am a fast learner with an open mind when it comes to learning, i believe that the first step in learning something new is viewing that thing as nothing(a tiny little ant that can be crushed). Picturing obstacles in this manner makes it easy for me to gear through till i feel very knowledgeable about the subject. <br><br>Presently, I am studying to become a notable and distinguished Devops Engineer and i know i will get there. <br> this website will be updated when i successfully get there in 4 months time.<br> <br> Tadaaa! You have met me :) </p>
